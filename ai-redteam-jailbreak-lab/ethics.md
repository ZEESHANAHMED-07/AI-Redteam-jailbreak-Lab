# Ethics and Responsible Use

## Purpose
This project is conducted solely for research, evaluation, and educational purposes.

The goal is to identify and document safety and alignment weaknesses in conversational AI systems in order to improve their robustness and reliability.

---

## Scope of Testing
All testing in this repository:
- Uses publicly accessible AI interfaces
- Avoids automation or large-scale exploitation
- Simulates realistic adversarial user behavior
- Focuses on documentation rather than misuse

No testing involves access to internal systems, proprietary data, or privileged model controls.

---

## Content Handling
Some documented interactions may involve sensitive or harmful topics.

To mitigate risk:
- Outputs are documented only to the extent necessary to demonstrate failure
- No content is optimized, refined, or operationalized for real-world misuse
- Context is preserved to prevent misinterpretation

---

## Boundaries and Exclusions
This project explicitly avoids:
- Generating or disseminating illegal content
- Providing actionable guidance for harm
- Targeting real individuals or groups
- Circumventing safeguards beyond documentation needs

Any testing that approaches ethical or legal ambiguity is halted and excluded from documentation.

---

## Responsible Disclosure
Findings are presented in a structured and non-sensational manner.

The intent is to:
- Inform AI safety research
- Support responsible deployment practices
- Encourage improved evaluation methodologies

This repository is not intended to promote exploitation or abuse of AI systems.
